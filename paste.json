You can fool around with the zoom variable, but anything less than 100 doesn't work. Space bar to show a jumping animation.\n\nCredits:\n• Programming, animation all by me, in Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu).\n• Character art was taken from the Scratch costume library.\n• Background was ripped from Lunar Legend (by Game Arts).\n• Sounds were ripped from Dragon Quest IV (DS remake; by Square Enix).\n• Music was ripped from Grandia Parallel Trippers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwzrGxjcLCs\n• Battle system concept pretty much copied from Grandia and similar games (by Game Arts, Square Enix).\n",

Compare with rev-16!\n• Monsters now attack Player 3, finally!\n• Probably fixed a few other bugs.\n• Text layering is broken. Hey ST, can we please let sprites move off the stage's view? That would be aweeesome.\n• Added some (project) tags. Probably won't keep up with these though!\n• Changed the music and background because meh it's time for a change.
